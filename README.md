# Google chrome extension for tbmp (The Bookmark Project).

I might not continue this project because the very api it depended upon ([tbmp](https://github.com/arrc/tbmp) api) is
no longer going to be developed further on MEAN because it was succeded by [Bloi] (http://github.com/arrc/bloi.co)
a rails version of tbmp.

- this project really pushed my limits in javascript.
- I got to implement and play with several javascript design patterns.
- Developing a Chrome extension (or any other message based api) is an experience in it self.
